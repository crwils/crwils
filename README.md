### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Craig - a Junior Software Developer from Edinburgh, Scotland.

After four years working as a recruiter in the tech industry in Dubai, I made a career change into tech. In July, I graduated from CodeClan in Edinburgh - an SQA accredited Digital Skills Academy teaching the fundamentals of Software Development through over 800 hours coding. 

Over the 16 weeks, I learned how to create full-stack web applications from scratch using various languages, libraries and frameworks including JavaScript, React, React Native, Express, Java, Spring Boot, Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, & SQL.

I encourage you to check out my pinned repos below which are some of the larger projects I did as part of the course! 

If you'd like to connect with me, I'm available on both  <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/crwils/"><img height="20px" width="20px" src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/174/174857.png"/> </a>  and  <a href="http://www.twitter.com/cr_wils"> <img height="20px" width="20px" src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/124/124021.png"/> </a>, <b>or</b> you can drop me an <b><a href="mailto:craigwilsonmusic@gmail.com">email</a></b> - I'd love to hear from you!
