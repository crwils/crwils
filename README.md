Hello Github ü§öüèº

I'm Craig, a Front End Developer based in Edinburgh, UK.

I was afforded the opportunity to leave behind my old tech recruitment career in Dubai and pivot into software development thanks to a much publicised global pandemic back in late 2020, and haven't looked back since.

Currently, I work at Glasgow-based start-up/scale-up Gigged.AI, where I help build and maintain our Open & Internal Talent Marketplaces. My primary focus is front-end development using React and TypeScript, though working in a small team means I also get to enjoy occasional forays into .NET and C# for backend development.

I‚Äôm always working on new projects and refining my skills, while doing my best to avoid blindly jumping on every shiny new Javascript-related bandwagon that rolls through‚Äîthough sometimes, resistance is futile. 

Check out my pinned repositories below for a mix of projects from my time at CodeClan and some recent personal work. More updates coming soon!
