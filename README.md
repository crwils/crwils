Hello Github ü§öüèº

I'm Craig, a Front End Developer based in Edinburgh, UK.

After four years living overseas as a tech recruiter in the UAE, I made the switch to software development. In July 2021, I graduated from CodeClan's digital skills academy, where I earned an SQA-accredited diploma.

Currently, I work at Gigged.AI, where I help build and maintain a cutting-edge talent marketplace. My primary focus is front-end development using React and TypeScript, though working in a small team means I also get to enjoy occasional forays into .NET and C# for backend development.

I‚Äôm always working on new projects and refining my skills. Check out my pinned repositories below for a mix of projects from my time at CodeClan and some recent personal work. More updates coming soon!
